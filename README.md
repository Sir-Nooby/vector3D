# Vector 3D - A 3D Vector Simulation Tool

Thanks for using our program!

I will be updating this documentation soon!!

For now,
# Modes:

## Draw Mode:
Draw vectors using your mouse. Hold down to create an origin point and drag around the screen to mark the final point, a simulated vector should appear denoting your position. Note: Sometimes a vector cannot go exactly where you would like it to be, thats because you are clicking a 3D space with a 2D mouse.

## Vector Mode:
Create vectors using points. Check whether to start from the origin or not, and input your start and end points one coordinate at a time. When finished click "Go" and your vector should be generated!

# Extra Features:

## Hover Capability:
Hover over a vector to see some information, including angles, start and end positions, and its magnitude

## Show Inverted Axis:
Toggle between both the positive and negative axes, or just the positive

## Show Tick Marks:
Toggle between simulated tick marks that show 1 unit in every direction

## Show Axis Planes:
Toggle between the axis planes (NOTE: causes lag)

## Show Box Models:
Toggle between a box model for every vector. This displays a hypothetical box that show the process of drawing vectors, helpful for visualization

If you come across any issues, or have any ideas for features let us know!
Thanks for using Vector3D.
