Comprehensive Mini Guide on Converting into HTML:

1. Use the glowscript website to run the base python file

2. Once loaded, paste the main.py file into the Glowscript

3. Remove the import math line as Glowscript does not require it

4. Update version number (if necessary)

5. Export the file into HTML

scene = canvas(width=1200, height=425, background=color.white, resizable=True, title="Vector3D - A Vector Mapping Tool (V1.0)                        Created by <a href='https://github.com/Sir-Nooby' target='_blank'>SirNooby</a> and <a href='https://github.com/ZakichanMC' target='_blank'>Zakichan</a>                                   Need Help? <a href=https://github.com/Sir-Nooby/vector3D?tab=readme-ov-file#vector-3d---a-3d-vector-simulation-tool target='_blank'> Read the Vector3D Documentation</a>") #Change the height if using Web VPython (475)
